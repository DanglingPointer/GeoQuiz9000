# Create a new Map-Pack

1. Create a new Folder for you Map-Pack
2. Copy one of the map.toml template files into it, make sure to remove the last part (.picture|.google, it's name has to be map.toml in the final map pack)
3. Copy all images you need for your Map-Pack into the folder, the prefered file-format is jpg, but png will just do fine.
4. Modify the the map.toml file so that it contains all information it needs. The template files contain additonal information about the option, as comments.'#' starts a line comment, and everything after it in a line will be ignored. For more information about .toml see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

A finished Map Pack should look like this:
```
my-map-pack.zip
|-norway
 |-map.toml
 |-trondheim.jpg
 |-bergen.jpg
 |-oslo.jpg
```
